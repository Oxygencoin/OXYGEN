# WHAT IS OXYGEN?
Oxygen is a decentralized digital currency that allows you to invest in improving the process of mining (Non-Stop Mining).

# WHAT DO WE OFFER

# HOW DOES IT WORK?
ASIC, video card, processor, power supply - this type of equipment is supplied with fans (coolers) for cooling. Even in the cleanest rooms allocated for mining, air quality leaves much to be desired. In the course of daily work fine dust damages the ventilation ducts, cooling blades and radiators of equipment. In consequence, the equipment undergoes intense heat and breaks down.

**The oxygen cleaning unit Oxygen B-Air Cleaner solves this problem.** Passing dozens of cycles of recirculation through the installation, the air in the room is cleaned and cooled. The five-step cleaning of air allows to detain both large particles of dust, and dust invisible to the human eye.
